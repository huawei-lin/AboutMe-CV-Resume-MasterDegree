## PROJECTS
<font size='5px'>Institute of Artificial Intelligence, SUST, China, <i>September 2017 - Present</i></font>

<font size='4px'><b>Human Tactile Brain Function Topological Analysis Platform Based on functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)</b></font>

- <font size='3px'>The project is a collaboration between Dr. Qi Yong and Xijing Hospital in Xi’an. This project performs a universal topological analysis of the functional activation regions of the tactile stimuli of the human brain, and aims to find the mapping relationship between human skin tactile sensors and the brain.</font>
- <font size='3px'>This project has been selected as 2019 National Training Program of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates, and received national project funding. </font>
- <font size='3px'>I am the team leader of this project group, and is responsible for the research and optimization of deep learning algorithms. Based on this project, I proposed a method using weighted heat maps to visualize the brain activation area, and used methods such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to improve the interpretability of the algorithm.</font>

<font size='4px'><b>Crystal Material Growth Quality Analysis Method Based on SEM Image</b></font>

- <font size='3px'>This project is an interdisciplinary research project in cooperation with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and the Institute of Advanced Energy. In the subject of materials, there are usually hundreds or even thousands of crystals in an electron microscope image. Traditional measurement methods rely on manual measurement. The project aims to find an automatic measurement algorithm to obtain the length and angle of each crystal in the image. The project is still working on algorithm research.</font>
- <font size='3px'>In this project, I was responsible for crystal extraction, key point detection and crystal length
calculation. Based on the problem of key point connection, I designed algorithms such as Part Affinity Fields(PAF) and Bipartite Graph Matching to solve the problem of key point connection. In addition, I proposed the Histogram of Oriented Gradient of the Adaptive Candidate Box (HOG-ACB) to extract crystals of different sizes.</font>

<font size='4px'><b>Depth Convolution Self-Coding Network for Gender Classification of 2D Fingerprints</b></font>

- <font size='3px'>The project uses self-encoding network to extract gender-related information in complex abstract features, embody abstract features, frees manual labor, and has higher accuracy than traditional feature extraction. The experimental results have an average accuracy of 95% and the best model in this experiment is used to test each pair of fingers to find the pair of fingers with the most obvious features. Related articles and patents are being written.</font>
- <font size='3px'>I am responsible for the establishment and optimization of the deep learning network in this project. In this project, I designed a residual block network suitable for experimental data to improve performance.</font>

<font size='4px'><b>Thin Film Quality Analysis Platform Based on SEM Image</b></font>

- <font size='3px'>The project is an interdisciplinary research project between Dr. Qi Yong and Dr. Yu Chenglong from the Advanced Energy Research Institute. The platform is designed to perform film quality analysis on the filter pore area and size distribution of the ion filter membrane using an ion-filtered film image taken by a scanning electron microscope. The platform has been completed and delivered for use.</font>
- <font size='3px'>In this project, I was responsible for designing the algorithm to locate the filter holes and calculate the area of the holes. I propose a neighborhood-based search method suitable for this project.</font>

<font size='4px'><b>3D Reconstruction Analysis Platform for Single-slewing Image</b></font>

- <font size='3px'>It is a platform for 3D modeling of a single-slewing body image independently developed by our research institute. Its core algorithm only needs to input a single-turn image to perform 3D reconstruction. This project won the national third prize in the 2019 Chinese University Computer Design Competition and has been applied in the field of ceramic cultural relics restoration.</font>
- <font size='3px'>I am responsible for data preprocessing in the team. I propose a method for extracting the foreground of the image.</font>
